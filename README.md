# Encryption Program (OOP and Tkinter)

## Overview

This project is an encryption program built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using various encryption algorithms.

## Features

- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter to provide an intuitive interface for users.
- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms**: Supports different encryption methods such as Caesar Cipher and Vernam Cipher.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Users can easily switch between encrypting and decrypting messages.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows users to customize encryption settings such as keys and shifts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python)
- Matplotlib library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-program.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd encryption-program
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the program by running `main.py`.
2. Select the encryption algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Provide the necessary key or settings for the chosen algorithm.
5. The result will be updated live as you type.
